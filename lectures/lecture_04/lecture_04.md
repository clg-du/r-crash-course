In this lecture, we will learn about comparison and logical operators in R.

Comparison operators are used to compare values and return logical values
(`TRUE` or `FALSE`) based on the comparison. Logical operators are used to
combine multiple logical values and return a single logical value.

## Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare values and return logical values
(`TRUE` or `FALSE`) based on the comparison.

The following comparison operators are commonly used in R:

- Equal to: `==`
- Not equal to: `!=`
- Greater than: `>`
- Greater than or equal to: `>=`
- Less than: `<`
- Less than or equal to: `<=`

`TRUE` and `FALSE` are special values in R that represent logical values.
`TRUE` is used to represent a logical value of `TRUE`, and `FALSE` is used to
represent a logical value of `FALSE`. In R, `TRUE` and `FALSE` are predefined
constants that are used to represent logical values. We can also use `T` and
`F` as shorthand for `TRUE` and `FALSE`.


``` r
print(TRUE)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

``` r
print(FALSE)
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

``` r
print(T)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

``` r
print(F)
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

Extra: If one sets `T <- FALSE`, or vice versa, the logical values will be
       updated for the these variables! Do not do this in practice, as it can
       lead to confusion... 

...and do not be mean to other programmers! ;)

Let's perform some comparison operations in R!
Equal to (`==`)


``` r
result_equal_to <- 5 == 3
print(result_equal_to)
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

Not equal to (`!=`)


``` r
result_not_equal_to <- 5 != 3
print(result_not_equal_to)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

Greater than (`>`)


``` r
result_greater_than <- 5 > 3
print(result_greater_than)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

Greater than or equal to (`>=`)


``` r
result_greater_than_or_equal_to <- 5 >= 3
print(result_greater_than_or_equal_to)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

Less than (`<`)


``` r
result_less_than <- 5 < 3
print(result_less_than)
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

Less than or equal to (`<=`)


``` r
result_less_than_or_equal_to <- 5 <= 3
print(result_less_than_or_equal_to)
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine multiple logical values and return a
single logical value. The following logical operators are commonly used in R:
- AND: `&` (both conditions must be TRUE)
- OR: `|` (at least one condition must be TRUE)
- NOT: `!` (negates the logical value)

Let's perform some logical operations in R!

AND (`&`)


``` r
result_and <- TRUE & FALSE
print(result_and)
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

OR (`|`)


``` r
result_or <- TRUE | FALSE
print(result_or)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

NOT (`!`)


``` r
result_not <- !TRUE
print(result_not)
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

In this lecture, we learned about comparison and logical operators in R,
including equal to, not equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to,
less than, less than or equal to, AND, OR, and NOT.

In the next lecture, we will learn about vectors in R.
