In this lecture, we will learn about indexing using logical vectors in R.

Logical vectors are vectors that contain logical values (`TRUE` or `FALSE`).
They are commonly used to filter and subset data in R.

Let's create a vector of numeric values.



Create a logical vector based on a condition We can use comparison operators
to create logical vectors based on conditions. For example, to create a
logical vector that indicates whether each element of `my_vector` is greater
than `3`, we can use the following syntax:



Display the logical vector


```
## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE
```

The resulting logical vector contains TRUE for elements that satisfy the
condition (greater than `3`) and `FALSE` for elements that do not.

## Indexing using logical vectors 

We can use logical vectors to index elements of a vector. When we use a
logical vector to index a vector, only the elements corresponding to `TRUE`
values are returned.

This will return only the elements of `my_vector` that satisfy the condition
(greater than `3`).



Display the result vector


```
## [1] 4 5
```

We could have skipped the creation of the logical vector and directly used
the condition in the square brackets. This is a common practice in R and can
make the code more concise.

Index the vector directly using the condition



Display the result vector


```
## [1] 4 5
```

This approach is often used in R to filter and subset data based on
conditions.

Let's try again using some other conditions!

Index the vector using a different condition



Display the result vector


```
## [1] 1 2 3
```

Index the vector using another condition



Display the result vector


```
## [1] 3
```

Index the vector using a combination of conditions



Display the result vector


```
## [1] 3 4
```

Logical vectors are powerful tools for filtering and subsetting data in R.
They allow us to apply conditions to data and extract specific elements that
meet those conditions.

That's it for this lecture! In the next lecture, we will learn about factors
in R.
