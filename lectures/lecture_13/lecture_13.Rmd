# Lecture 13: A real-world example of using R for data analysis

# In this lecture, we will work on a real-world example of using R for data analysis.
# We will load a dataset and perform some basic data exploration and analysis.

# Load the dataset

# The dataset we will be using is the "mtcars" dataset, which is a built-in dataset in R.
# The dataset contains information about various car models, including the number of cylinders, horsepower, and miles per gallon (mpg).

# Let's load the dataset and take a look at the first few rows.

# Load the mtcars dataset
data(mtcars)

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
head(mtcars)

# Check the structure of the dataset
str(mtcars)

# Summary of the dataset
summary(mtcars)

# These steps provide us with an overview of the dataset, including the column names, data types, and summary statistics.
# We can see that the dataset contains 32 observations and 11 variables.
# The variables include the number of cylinders, horsepower, and miles per gallon (mpg) of each car model.
# We can use this information to perform further analysis and visualization of the dataset.

# The dataset contains the following columns:'

# - mpg: Miles/(US) gallon
# - cyl: Number of cylinders
# - disp: Displacement (cu.in.)
# - hp: Gross horsepower
# - drat: Rear axle ratio
# - wt: Weight (1000 lbs)
# - qsec: 1/4 mile time
# - vs: V/S

# It is also possible to use the help function to get more information about the dataset (since it is a built-in dataset in R).

# Help on the mtcars dataset



#help(mtcars)



# This provides additional information about the dataset, including the source and description of the dataset.

# Now that we have loaded and explored the dataset, we can perform further analysis and visualization to gain insights from the data.

# For example, we can create a scatter plot of miles per gallon (mpg) versus horsepower to see if there is a relationship between the two variables.

# Create a scatter plot of mpg vs. hp
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg, xlab = "Horsepower", ylab = "Miles per Gallon", main = "Scatter Plot of MPG vs. Horsepower")

# The scatter plot shows the relationship between miles per gallon (mpg) and horsepower for the car models in the dataset.
# We can see that there is a negative relationship between the two variables, with higher horsepower values corresponding to lower miles per gallon values.
# The help page for the plot() function provides more information about customizing plots and adding labels and titles.
# It also informs us what the arguments are and how they can be used.


#?plot



# We see that x and y are the variables to be plotted, xlab and ylab are the labels for the x and y axes, and main is the title of the plot.
# Again, the help function is a valuable resource for learning more about functions and how to use them in R.

# Let's continue exploring the dataset and performing further analysis to gain insights from the data.

# For instance we can calculate the correlation between the variables in the dataset.

# Calculate the correlation matrix
correlation_matrix <- cor(mtcars)

# Display the correlation matrix
print(correlation_matrix)

# It is clear that the correlation matrix provides information about the relationships between the variables in the dataset.
# We can see that some variables are positively correlated, while others are negatively correlated.

# We can also visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap to better understand the relationships between the variables.

# Create a heatmap of the correlation matrix
heatmap(correlation_matrix, col = heat.colors(10), symm = TRUE, margins = c(10, 10))

# The heatmap provides a visual representation of the correlation matrix, with warmer colors indicating stronger positive correlations and cooler colors indicating stronger negative correlations.
# This visualization can help us identify patterns and relationships between the variables in the dataset.

# Let's add a legend to the heatmap to better understand the color scale.

# Add a legend to the heatmap
# Note that we can organize the code in a more readable way by breaking it into multiple lines.
# This makes it easier to understand and modify the code.
# The linebreaks can occur after commas or operators.
legend("bottomright",
    legend = c(
        "Strong Negative Correlation",
        "Weak Negative Correlation",
        "No Correlation",
        "Weak Positive Correlation",
        "Strong Positive Correlation"
    ),
    fill = heat.colors(5),
    bty = "n",
    ncol = 1,
    cex = 0.8,
    title = "Correlation Strength"
)
