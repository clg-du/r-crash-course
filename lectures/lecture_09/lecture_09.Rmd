# In this lecture, we will learn about functions in R.

# We have encountered functions in previous lectures, such as the print() function, which is used to display output in R.
# Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task when called or invoked.
# They are essential for organizing and reusing code in R.

# Functions in R...

# ...are defined using the function() keyword.
# ...can take zero or more arguments as input.
# ...can return zero or more values as output.
# ...can be built-in functions provided by R or user-defined functions created by the programmer.
# ...can have default argument values.
# ...can have named arguments.
# ...can be called with or without parentheses.

# Let's define a simple function in R!

# Define a function that adds two numbers
add_numbers <- function(a, b) {
  result <- a + b
  return(result)
}

# The function add_numbers() takes two arguments, a and b, and returns their sum.

# Call the function with arguments 5 and 3
result_addition <- add_numbers(5, 3)

# Display the result
print(result_addition)

# The function add_numbers() is defined using the function() keyword.
# It takes two arguments, a and b, and returns their sum.
# The return() statement is used to return the result of the addition.
# We call the function with arguments 5 and 3, and store the result in the variable result_addition.
# This is a simple example of a user-defined function in R.

# Beyond user-defined functions, R provides a wide range of built-in functions that perform various tasks.
# For example, the sum() function calculates the sum of a vector of numbers.

# Calculate the sum of a vector of numbers
numbers <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
result_sum <- sum(numbers)

# Display the result
print(result_sum)

# The sum() function is a built-in function in R that calculates the sum of a vector of numbers.
# We create a vector of numbers using the c() function and store it in the variable numbers.
# We call the sum() function with the vector of numbers as an argument and store the result in the variable result_sum.
# This demonstrates how built-in functions can be used to perform common tasks in R.

# But it is impossible to know what every function does just by looking at its name, right?
# That's where the help() function comes in handy!
help(sum)

# It can also be called with a question mark
?sum

# The help() function provides information about a specific function in R.
# We call the help() function with the sum() function as an argument to get information about the sum() function.
# The help page for the sum() function provides a description of the function, its usage, arguments, and examples.
# This is a useful way to learn more about built-in functions and how to use them in R.
# You can also use the question mark ? before the function name to get the same information.

# Pro tip is to scroll down to the examples section of the help page for practical examples of how to use the function.
# That is a "quick and dirty" way to learn how to use a function without reading the entire documentation.

# Functions in R can have default argument values, which are used when an argument is not provided by the user.
# This allows functions to be more flexible and easier to use.

# Define a function with default argument values
greet_person <- function(name = "friend") {
  message <- paste("Hello,", name, "!")
  return(message)
}

# Note here that paste() is a function that concatenates strings together.
# So we have nested functions here, which is a common practice in R.

# Call the function without an argument
result_greeting <- greet_person()

# Display the result
print(result_greeting)

# Call the function with an argument
result_greeting <- greet_person("Alice")

# Display the result
print(result_greeting)

# The greet_person() function is defined with a default argument value of "friend".
# If no argument is provided, the function greets the user as "friend".
# We call the greet_person() function without an argument and store the result in the variable result_greeting.
# The function greets the user as "friend" and returns the greeting message.
# We call the greet_person() function with the argument "Alice" and store the result in the variable result_greeting.
# The function greets the user as "Alice" and returns the greeting message.
# This demonstrates how default argument values can be used to make functions more flexible and user-friendly.

# Functions in R can also have named arguments, which allow arguments to be passed in any order by specifying the argument name.

# Define a function with named arguments
calculate_area <- function(length = 1, width = 1) {
  area <- length * width
  return(area)
}

# Call the function with named arguments
result_area <- calculate_area(width = 5, length = 3)

# Display the result
print(result_area)

# The calculate_area() function is defined with named arguments length and width.
# This allows the arguments to be passed in any order by specifying the argument name.
# We resversed the order of the arguments when calling the function, and it still works as expected.

# If we already know the order of the arguments, we can still call the function without specifying the argument names.

# Call the function without specifying argument names
result_area <- calculate_area(3, 5)

# Display the result
print(result_area)

# It is then important to know the order of the arguments when calling the function without specifying the argument names.
# Otherwise the function may not work as expected.

# Many programmers can get by with only returning a single value from a function.
# But eventually one may want to return multiple values from a function.
# This can be done by returning a list, which can store multiple objects of different types!
# The list in of itself is a single object that can store multiple objects,
# which is a neat trick to return multiple values from a function.

# Define a function that returns multiple values
calculate_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  circumference <- 2 * pi * radius
  return(list(area = area, circumference = circumference))
}

# Call the function with a radius of 5
result_circle <- calculate_circle(5)

# Display the result
print(result_circle)

# The calculate_circle() function calculates the area and circumference of a circle given its radius.
# The function returns a list containing the area and circumference as named elements.
# We call the calculate_circle() function with a radius of 5 and store the result in the variable result_circle.
# The result is a list containing the area and circumference of the circle, which can be accessed by their names.

# It is therefore possible to access individual list elements using the double square brackets "[[]]" or the dollar sign "$".

# Access the area of the circle
print(result_circle$area)

# Access the circumference of the circle
print(result_circle$circumference)

# This is a powerful feature of R that allows functions to return multiple values in a structured way.

# That's it for this lecture on functions in R! A bit longer than the previous ones, but functions are a fundamental concept in programming.
# Functions are an essential part of programming in R, and understanding how to define and use functions is key 
# to writing efficient and reusable code.

# In the next lecture, we will learn about indexing using logical vectors in R.
