In this lecture, we will learn about objects, data types, and variables in R.

Objects are the basic building blocks of R, and they can store data,
functions, or other objects. R has several built-in data types, including
numeric, character, logical, integer, and complex.

Variables...

- are used to store objects in R, and they can be assigned using the
  assignment operator `<-`. (or `=`, but `<-` is preferred!)
- in R are case-sensitive, so `myVar` is not the same as `myvar`.
- have names in R which can contain letters, numbers, underscores, and dots,
  but they cannot start with a number.
- can be assigned to objects, data, functions, or other variables.

Let's create some variables in R!

Create a numeric variable


``` r
my_num <- 42
```

Create a character variable


``` r
my_char <- "Hello, World!"
```

Create a logical variable


``` r
my_logical <- TRUE
```

Create an integer variable Note: In R, integers are specified by adding an
`L` to the end of the number (`L` stands for "long integer"). This tells R to
treat the number as an integer rather than a numeric value.


``` r
my_int <- 42L
```

Create a complex variable Note: In R, complex numbers are specified using the
`i` suffix. The real part is separated from the imaginary part by a `+` sign.
We won't be using complex numbers at all in this course, but it's good to
know they exist!


``` r
my_complex <- 3 + 4i
```

Display the values of the variables


``` r
print(my_num)
```

```
## [1] 42
```

``` r
print(my_char)
```

```
## [1] "Hello, World!"
```

``` r
print(my_logical)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

``` r
print(my_int)
```

```
## [1] 42
```

``` r
print(my_complex)
```

```
## [1] 3+4i
```

That's it for this example! In the next lecture, we will learn about
arithmetic operations in R.
