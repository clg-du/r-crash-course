# Lecture 3: Arithmetic Operations in R

# In this lecture, we will learn about arithmetic operations in R.
# R provides a wide range of operators for performing mathematical calculations on numeric data.

# Arithmetic operators in R
# R supports the following arithmetic operators:
# - Addition: +
# - Subtraction: -
# - Multiplication: *
# - Division: /
# - Exponentiation: ^
# - Modulo: %% (returns the remainder of a division)

# Let's perform some arithmetic operations in R!

# Addition
result_addition <- 5 + 3
print(result_addition)

# Subtraction
result_subtraction <- 5 - 3
print(result_subtraction)

# Multiplication
result_multiplication <- 5 * 3
print(result_multiplication)

# Division
result_division <- 5 / 3
print(result_division)

# Exponentiation
result_exponentiation <- 5 ^ 3
print(result_exponentiation)

# Modulo
result_modulo <- 5 %% 3
print(result_modulo)

# Order of operations
# R follows the standard order of operations in mathematics:
# - Parentheses ()
# - Exponentiation ^
# - Multiplication * and Division /
# - Addition + and Subtraction -

# We can use parentheses to change the order of operations.
# For example, to calculate 5 + 3 * 2, we can use parentheses to ensure that the multiplication is performed first:
result_order_of_operations <- 5 + 3 * 2
print(result_order_of_operations)

# Using parentheses to change the order of operations
result_order_of_operations_parentheses <- (5 + 3) * 2
print(result_order_of_operations_parentheses)

# R DOES NOT provides shorthand operators for performing arithmetic operations and updating variables.
# In Python and other programming languages, shorthand operators are used to perform an arithmetic operation 
# and update a variable in a single step.
# Instead we need to use the following syntax in R to iterate a variable and update it:
x <- 5
x <- x + 1
print(x)

# In this lecture, we learned about arithmetic operations in R, 
# including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and modulo.
# We also learned about the order of operations in R and how to use parentheses to change the order of operations.

# In the next lecture, we will learn about comparison and logical operators in R.
