## Task 1: Conditional Statements

Write the if-else statement to check if a value is even or odd and print the
appropriate message.

Hint: Use the modulo operator `%%` to check for evenness.

Your code here:


``` r
# Task 1: Conditional Statements

# Write the if-else statement to check if a value is even or odd and print the
# appropriate message.

# Your code here:
value <- 7

if (value %% 2 == 0) {
    print("The value is even.")
} else {
    print("The value is odd.")
}
```

```
## [1] "The value is odd."
```

## Task 2: Loops

Write a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 5.

Your code here:


``` r
for (i in 1:5) {
    print(i)
}
```

```
## [1] 1
## [1] 2
## [1] 3
## [1] 4
## [1] 5
```

## Task 3: Functions

Write a function called "square" that takes a number as input and returns its
square.

Your code here:


``` r
squared_number <- function(x) {
    return(x^2)
}
```

## Task 4: Putting It All Together

Write a for loop to print the squares of the numbers from 1 to a number `n`
using the "square" function.

Your code here:


``` r
n <- 5

for (i in 1:n) {
    print(squared_number(i))
}
```

```
## [1] 1
## [1] 4
## [1] 9
## [1] 16
## [1] 25
```

## Task 5: Advanced Control Structures

Write an if-else statement that evalutes grades from an exam and prints the
corresponding message based on the grade:

- A: Excellent
- B: Good
- C: Satisfactory
- D: Needs Improvement
- F: Fail

The grading scale is as follows:

- A: 90-100
- B: 80-89
- C: 70-79
- D: 60-69
- F: 0-59

Your code here:


``` r
grade <- 85

if (grade >= 90) {
    print("Excellent")
} else if (grade >= 80) {
    print("Good")
} else if (grade >= 70) {
    print("Satisfactory")
} else if (grade >= 60) {
    print("Needs Improvement")
} else {
    print("Fail")
}
```

```
## [1] "Good"
```

That's it for Exercise 12! Well done!
