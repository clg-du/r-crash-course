## Task 1: Creating Lists

Create the following lists and assign them to variables:

1. Create a list with the following elements: 10, "red", TRUE, 3.14 and
   assign it to a variable called `my_list`.

2. Create a list with the following named elements: "name" with value "John",
   "age" with value 25, "city" with value "New York" and assign it to a
   variable called `person`.

Your code here:


``` r
my_list <- list(10, "red", TRUE, 3.14)
person <- list(name = "John", age = 25, city = "New York")
```

## Task 2: Accessing List Elements

Use indexing to perform the following operations:

1. Access the second element of the first list and assign it to a variable
   called `list_element`.

2. Access the value of the "age" element in the second list and assign it to
   a variable called `age`.

Your code here:


``` r
list_element <- my_list[[2]]
age <- person$age
```

## Task 3: Manipulating Lists

Perform the following operations on the lists:

1. Add a new element to the first list with the value "blue" and assign the
   modified list to a new variable called `modified_list`.

2. Change the value of the "city" element in the second list to "San
   Francisco".

Your code here:


``` r
modified_list <- c(my_list, "blue")
person$city <- "San Francisco"
```

## Task 4: A list of lists... of lists!

Consider this ridiculousness of nested lists:


``` r
nested_lists <- list(
    list(
        list(c(1, 2, 3), c("a", "b", "c"), c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)),
        list(c(4, 5, 6), c("d", "e", "f"), c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)),
        list(c(7, 8, 9), c("g", "h", "i"), c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE))
    ),
    list(
        list(c(10, 11, 12), c("j", "k", "l"), c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)),
        list(c(13, 14, 15), c("m", "n", "o"), c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)),
        list(c(16, 17, 18), c("p", "q", "r"), c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE))
    ),
    list(
        list(c(19, 20, 21), c("s", "t", "u"), c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)),
        list(c(22, 23, 24), c("v", "w", "x"), c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE)),
        list(c(25, 26, 27), c("y", "z", "aa"), c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE))
    )
)
```

Access the following elements from the nested list:

1. The letter "w".

2. The number 14.

3. The vector of logical values c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE) (i.e., all TRUE).

Your code here:


``` r
letter_w <- nested_lists[[2]][[2]][[2]][2]
number_14 <- nested_lists[[2]][[2]][[1]][2]
logical_vector_true <- nested_lists[[3]][[3]][[3]]
```

That's it for Exercise 6! Well done!
