2024-08-24


## Task 1: Create Numeric Variables

Create two numeric variables, `num1` and `num2`, and assign them any numeric values.

Your code here:


``` r
num1 <- 10.5
num2 <- 7.2
```

## Task 2: Create Character Variables

Create two character variables, `char1` and `char2`, and assign them any strings.

Your code here:


``` r
char1 <- "Hello"
char2 <- "World"
```

## Task 3: Create Logical Variables

Create two logical variables, `logical1` and `logical2`, and assign them any logical values.

Your code here:


``` r
logical1 <- TRUE
logical2 <- FALSE
```

## Task 4: Create Integer Variables

Create two integer variables, `int1` and `int2`, and assign them any integer values.

Your code here:


``` r
int1 <- 5
int2 <- -3
```

## Task 5: Create Complex Variables

Create two complex variables, `complex1` and `complex2`, and assign them any complex values.

Your code here:


``` r
complex1 <- 2 + 3i
complex2 <- -1 + 4i
```

## Task 6: Display the Values of the Variables

Print the values of all the variables created above.

Your code here:


``` r
print(num1)
```

```
## [1] 10.5
```

``` r
print(num2)
```

```
## [1] 7.2
```

``` r
print(char1)
```

```
## [1] "Hello"
```

``` r
print(char2)
```

```
## [1] "World"
```

``` r
print(logical1)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

``` r
print(logical2)
```

```
## [1] FALSE
```

``` r
print(int1)
```

```
## [1] 5
```

``` r
print(int2)
```

```
## [1] -3
```

``` r
print(complex1)
```

```
## [1] 2+3i
```

``` r
print(complex2)
```

```
## [1] -1+4i
```

That's it for Exercise 2! Well done!
