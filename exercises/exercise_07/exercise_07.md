## Task 1: Creating Matrices

Create the following matrices and assign them to variables:

1. Create a matrix with the following elements: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and assign
   it to a variable called `matrix1`. The matrix should have 2 rows and 3
   columns.

2. Create a matrix with the following named elements: "A" with value 10, "B"
   with value 20, "C" with value 30, "D" with value 40 and assign it to a
   variable called `matrix2`. The matrix should have 2 rows and 2 columns.

Your code here:
## Task 2: Accessing Matrix Elements

Use indexing to perform the following operations:

1. Access the element in the first row and second column of `matrix1` and
   assign it to a variable called `element1`.

2. Access the value of the "B" element in the second row of `matrix2` and
   assign it to a variable called `element2`.

Your code here:
## Task 3: Manipulating Matrices

Perform the following operations on the matrices:

1. Add a new row to `matrix1` with the values 7, 8, 9.

2. Change the value of the "C" element in the first row of `matrix2` to 50.

Your code here:

That's it for Exercise 7! Well done!
