## Task 1: Comparison Operators

Perform the following comparison operations and assign the results to
variables:

1. Check if 5 is equal to 3 and assign the result to a variable called
   `equal_to_result`.

2. Check if 5 is not equal to 3 and assign the result to a variable called
   `not_equal_to_result`.

3. Check if 5 is greater than 3 and assign the result to a variable called
   `greater_than_result`.

4. Check if 5 is greater than or equal to 3 and assign the result to a
   variable called `greater_than_or_equal_to_result`.

5. Check if 5 is less than 3 and assign the result to a variable called
   `less_than_result`.

6. Check if 5 is less than or equal to 3 and assign the result to a variable
   called `less_than_or_equal_to_result`.

Your code here:
## Task 2: Logical Operators

Perform the following logical operations and assign the results to variables:

1. Perform an AND operation between TRUE and FALSE and assign the result to a
   variable called `and_result`.

2. Perform an OR operation between TRUE and FALSE and assign the result to a
   variable called `or_result`.

3. Perform a NOT operation on TRUE and assign the result to a variable called
   `not_result`.

Your code here:
## Task 3: Combining Comparison and Logical Operators

Combine comparison and logical operators to perform the following operations
and assign the results to variables:

1. Check if 5 is greater than 3 AND 4 is less than 6. Assign the result to a
   variable called `combined_and_result`.

2. Check if 5 is greater than 3 OR 4 is less than 6. Assign the result to a
   variable called `combined_or_result`.

Your code here:
That's it for Exercise 3! Great job!
