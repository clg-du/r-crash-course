## Task 1: Creating a Factor

Consider the following vector of fruit names:





Create a factor called `fruit_factor` from the `fruit_vector` using the
`factor()` function.




## Task 2: Specifying Factor Levels


Consider the following vector of T-shirt sizes:





Create a factor called `size_factor_specified` from the `size_vector` using
the `factor()` function. Specify the levels of the factor as "S", "M", "L",
and "XL".




## Task 3: Accessing Factor Levels


Access the levels of the `size_factor_specified` factor using the `levels()`
function and assign the result to a variable called `factor_levels`.




## Task 4: Modifying Factor Levels


Modify the levels of the `size_factor_specified` factor by changing the order
to "M", "S", "XL", and "L". Assign the modified factor to a variable called
`modified_factor`.




## Task 5: Factor Operations


Perform the following operations on the `size_factor_specified` factor and
assign the results to new variables:

1. Compute the frequency of each level in the factor and assign the result to
   a variable called `level_frequency`.




2. Compute the cumulative frequency of each level in the factor and assign
   the result to a variable called `cumulative_frequency`.




## Task 6: Using factors with real data

Consider the `mpg` data set from the ggplot2 package (install, if not already
installed)



You may read up on what each column is describing by using



There is a function in R called `unique()`. It tells us how many unique
values a certain vector contains. For instance, the following code gives us
information about all unique values of the cylinders, which is only 4 in
total.


```
## [1] 4 6 8 5
```

The normal case for when loading data into R, such as a .csv (comma seperated
value) file, is that factors are not included.

For this task, give suggestions on which variables can reasonably be turned
into factors, and, where applicable provide factor levels or even ordered
factors. Transform the columns accordingly!



Note that only `displ` and `hwy` could not reasonably be turned into factors.
However, if you do not find a NEED to transform into a factor variable, then
you may just as well skip doing so!

Finally, given the transformed data set, provide the following.

1. Cars with more than 4 cylinders but less than 8 cylinders.

2. A barplot of highway miles per gallon for each manufacturer.




That's it for Exercise 11! Great job!
