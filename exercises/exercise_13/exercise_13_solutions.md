## Task 1: Loading and Exploring Data

Load the `iris` data set, display the first few rows, check the structure,
and provide a summary of the data set.

Your code here:


``` r
# Load the iris dataset
data(iris)

# Display the first few rows
head(iris)
```

```
##   Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
## 1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
## 4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa
## 5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa
## 6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa
```

``` r
# Check the structure
str(iris)
```

```
## 'data.frame':	150 obs. of  5 variables:
##  $ Sepal.Length: num  5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5 5.4 4.6 5 4.4 4.9 ...
##  $ Sepal.Width : num  3.5 3 3.2 3.1 3.6 3.9 3.4 3.4 2.9 3.1 ...
##  $ Petal.Length: num  1.4 1.4 1.3 1.5 1.4 1.7 1.4 1.5 1.4 1.5 ...
##  $ Petal.Width : num  0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 ...
##  $ Species     : Factor w/ 3 levels "setosa","versicolor",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
```

``` r
# Summary of the dataset
summary(iris)
```

```
##   Sepal.Length    Sepal.Width     Petal.Length    Petal.Width   
##  Min.   :4.300   Min.   :2.000   Min.   :1.000   Min.   :0.100

##  virginica :50  
##                 
##                 
## 
```

## Task 2: Scatter Plot

Create a scatter plot of `Petal.Length` vs. `Petal.Width` from the `iris`
data set.

Hint: Use the `plot` function with the appropriate arguments.

Your code here:


``` r
# Scatter plot of Petal.Length vs. Petal.Width
plot(iris$Petal.Length,
    iris$Petal.Width,
    xlab = "Petal Length",
    ylab = "Petal Width",
    main = "Petal Length vs. Petal Width"
)
```

## Task 3: Bar Plot

Create a bar plot of the species counts from the `iris` data set.

Your code here:


``` r
# Bar plot of species counts
barplot(table(iris$Species),
        xlab = "Species",
        ylab = "Count",
        main = "Species Counts"
)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4](../../exercises/exercise_13/figures/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)

## Task 4: Box Plot

Create a box plot of `Sepal.Length` by species from the `iris` data set.

Your code here:


``` r
# Box plot of Sepal.Length by species
boxplot(Sepal.Length ~ Species,
        data = iris,
        xlab = "Species",
        ylab = "Sepal Length",
        main = "Sepal Length by Species"
)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-5](../../exercises/exercise_13/figures/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)

## Task 5: Histogram

Create a histogram of `Sepal.Width` from the `iris` data set.

Your code here:


``` r
# Histogram of Sepal.Width
hist(iris$Sepal.Width,
     xlab = "Sepal Width",
     ylab = "Frequency",
     main = "Histogram of Sepal Width"
)
```

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6](../../exercises/exercise_13/figures/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

## Task 6: Correlation Matrix

Compute the correlation matrix for the first four columns of the `iris` data
set and display it.

Your code here:


``` r
# Correlation matrix for the first four columns
cor(iris[, 1:4])
```

```
##              Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width
## Sepal.Length    1.0000000  -0.1175698    0.8717538   0.8179411
## Sepal.Width    -0.1175698   1.0000000   -0.4284401  -0.3661259
## Petal.Length    0.8717538  -0.4284401    1.0000000   0.9628654
## Petal.Width     0.8179411  -0.3661259    0.9628654   1.0000000
```

## Task 7: Heatmap of Correlation Matrix

Create a heatmap of the correlation matrix computed in the previous task.

Your code here:


``` r
# Compute the correlation matrix for the first four columns of the iris data set
cor_matrix <- cor(iris[, 1:4])

# Create a heatmap of the correlation matrix
heatmap(cor_matrix)
```

That's it for Exercise 13! Great job!
