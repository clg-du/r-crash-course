## Task 1: Loading and Exploring Data

Consider the following code snippet:

```r
# Load the iris data set
data(iris)

# Display the first few rows
head(iris)

# Check the structure
str(iris)

# Provide a summary
summary(iris)
```

Load the `iris` data set, display the first few rows, check the structure,
and provide a summary of the data set.

Your code here:
## Task 2: Scatter Plot

Consider the following code snippet:

```r
# Create a scatter plot of Petal.Length vs. Petal.Width
plot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Petal.Width,
     xlab = "Petal.Length", ylab = "Petal.Width",
     main = "Scatter Plot of Petal.Length vs. Petal.Width")
```

Create a scatter plot of `Petal.Length` vs. `Petal.Width` from the `iris`
data set.

Your code here:
## Task 3: Bar Plot

Consider the following code snippet:

```r
# Create a bar plot of the species counts
barplot(table(iris$Species),
        xlab = "Species",
        ylab = "Count",
        main = "Bar Plot of Species Counts")
```

Create a bar plot of the species counts from the `iris` data set.

Your code here:
## Task 4: Box Plot

Consider the following code snippet:

```r
# Create a box plot of Sepal.Length by species
boxplot(iris$Sepal.Length ~ iris$Species,
        xlab = "Species",
        ylab = "Sepal Length",
        main = "Box Plot of Sepal Length by Species")
```

Create a box plot of `Sepal.Length` by species from the `iris` data set.

Your code here:
## Task 5: Histogram

Consider the following code snippet:

```r
# Create a histogram of Sepal.Width
hist(iris$Sepal.Width,
     xlab = "Sepal Width",
     ylab = "Frequency",
     main = "Histogram of Sepal Width")
```

Create a histogram of `Sepal.Width` from the `iris` data set.

Your code here:
## Task 6: Correlation Matrix

Consider the following code snippet:

```r
# Compute the correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(iris[, 1:4])

# Display the correlation matrix
cor_matrix
```

Compute the correlation matrix for the first four columns of the `iris` data
set and display it.

Your code here:
## Task 7: Putting It All Together

Consider the following code snippet:

```r
# Load the mtcars data set
data(mtcars)

# Create a scatter plot of mpg vs. hp
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg,
     xlab = "Horsepower", ylab = "Miles per Gallon",
     main = "Scatter Plot of MPG vs. Horsepower")

# Create a bar plot of the number of cylinders
barplot(table(mtcars$cyl),
        xlab = "Number of Cylinders",
        ylab = "Count",
        main = "Bar Plot of Number of Cylinders")
```

Load the `mtcars` data set, create a scatter plot of `mpg` vs. `hp`, and
create a bar plot of the number of cylinders.

Your code here:
That's it for Exercise 13! Great job!
