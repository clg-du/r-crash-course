2024-08-24


## Task 1: Perform Arithmetic Operations

Perform the following arithmetic operations and assign the results to
variables:

1. Add 10 and 5 and assign the result to a variable called `addition_result`.

2. Subtract 7 from 15 and assign the result to a variable called
   `subtraction_result`.

3. Multiply 4 by 6 and assign the result to a variable called
   `multiplication_result`.

4. Divide 20 by 5 and assign the result to a variable called
   `division_result`.

5. Calculate the square of 9 and assign the result to a variable called
   `exponentiation_result`.

6. Find the remainder when 17 is divided by 4 and assign the result to a
   variable called `modulo_result`.

## Task 3: Order of Operations

Calculate the following expressions using the correct order of operations and
assign the results to variables:

1. Calculate 5 plus 3 times 2 and assign the result to a variable called
   `order_of_operations_result`.

2. Calculate the same expression but use parentheses to change the order of
   operations. Assign the result to a variable called
   `order_of_operations_parentheses_result`.
