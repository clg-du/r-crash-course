# Exercise 3: Arithmetic Operations in R

## Task 1: Perform Arithmetic Operations

# 1. Add 10 and 5 and assign the result to a variable called `addition_result`.
addition_result <- 10 + 5

# 2. Subtract 7 from 15 and assign the result to a variable called
#    `subtraction_result`.
subtraction_result <- 15 - 7

# 3. Multiply 4 by 6 and assign the result to a variable called
#    `multiplication_result`.
multiplication_result <- 4 * 6

# 4. Divide 20 by 5 and assign the result to a variable called
#    `division_result`.
division_result <- 20 / 5

# 5. Calculate the square of 9 and assign the result to a variable called
#    `exponentiation_result`.
exponentiation_result <- 9^2

# 6. Find the remainder when 17 is divided by 4 and assign the result to a
#    variable called `modulo_result`.
modulo_result <- 17 %% 4


## Task 2: Display the Results

# Print the values of all the variables created in Task 1.
print(addition_result)
print(subtraction_result)
print(multiplication_result)
print(division_result)
print(exponentiation_result)
print(modulo_result)


## Task 3: Order of Operations

# 1. Calculate 5 plus 3 times 2 and assign the result to a variable called
#    `order_of_operations_result`.
order_of_operations_result <- 5 + 3 * 2

# 2. Calculate the same expression but use parentheses to change the order of
#    operations. Assign the result to a variable called
#    `order_of_operations_parentheses_result`.
order_of_operations_parentheses_result <- (5 + 3) * 2


# Print the values of the variables created in Task 3.
print(order_of_operations_result)
print(order_of_operations_parentheses_result)


# That's it for Exercise 3! Great job!
