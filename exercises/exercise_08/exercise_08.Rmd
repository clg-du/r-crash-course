# Exercise 8: Data Frames in R
`r Sys.Date()`


## Task 1: Creating Data Frames

Create the following data frames and assign them to variables:

1. Create a data frame with the following columns:
   - name: "Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve"
   - age: 25, 30, 35, 40, 45
   - employed: TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE Assign the data frame to a
   variable called `df1`.

2. Create a data frame with the following columns:
   - city: "New York", "Los Angeles", "Chicago", "Houston", "Phoenix"
   - population: 8537673, 3976322, 2720546, 2296224, 1660272
   - state: "New York", "California", "Illinois", "Texas", "Arizona" Assign
   the data frame to a variable called `df2`.

## Task 2: Accessing Data Frame Elements

Use indexing to perform the following operations:

1. Access the element in the second row and third column of `df1` and assign
   it to a variable called `element1`.

2. Access the value of the "population" column in the fourth row of `df2` and
   assign it to a variable called `element2`.

## Task 3: Manipulating Data Frames

Perform the following operations on the data frames:

1. Add a new column to `df1` called "gender" with the values "female",
   "male", "male", "female", "female".

2. Change the value of the "state" column in the third row of `df2` to
   "Michigan".
